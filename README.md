# Engineering 4 Notebook
This is where all of my stuff will go!
## Assignments
### Hello World
We put together our Raspberry Pi Zero and Made it say Hello World! ten times
#### What we Learned
we were introduced to bash coding and how to set up our rapsberry pi
### Hello Mathematica
We launched the mathimatica program and made an animated graph
#### What we Learned
We learned what the mathimatica program is capable of and how to use it to a certain degree
### Auto Dice Roll Out
we created a python code that rolled for a random number on a "6 sided die"
#### What we Learned
we learned how to use while loops and how the random function works in python
#### Code
https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Auto%20Dice%20Roll%20Out.py
### Python Calculator Trial One and Two
We used Python to create a calculator that could do basic functions plus modulo
#### What we Learned
We learned about functions and we also learned how to use said functions to make our code smaller and more usable.
Also we learned how to create math functions within python and how to use them for other means
#### Code
https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/PythonCalcTrial1.py and https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/PythonCalcTrial2.py
### Python Quadratic Solver
We made a function in python that was able to tell if the input was factorable and by how much and then it factored it
#### What we Learned
We learned how to solve and use more complicated math formulas in python which will allow us to make better data and graphs using these equations.
#### Code
https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/PythonQuadraticSolver.py
### Hello Git
We created our github page and were able to connect it to our rapsberry pi
#### What we Learned
we learned how to push or pull information and data from our pi to our github page and vice versa
### Git - Forks and Clones
We made a Fork of a page created by the great and mighty Jack Timmins and were able to acces it and edit it because of what we did
#### What we Learned
We learned how to fork and clone and what the purpose of doing so is, which in  turn made us learn how to acces other peoples code and work to further advance our knowledge
### Git - Engineering 4 Notebook
We succesfully created an are in which to write our assignments and projects down
### Pyhton Program 03 Strings and Loops
we made a python program that was able to print words vertically by letter instead of horizontally
#### What we Learned
We learned what strings were and how they were used in code and also how the loops could be used to change and manipulate the strings.
### Hangman
We made a python script that set a certain number of levels and took a user inputed word to play out the game hangman
#### What we Learned
we gained knowledge about how to do multi line commenting, How to use the time import, how to extend lists and how to create them, and we leaned how to creat our own imports from our files.
#### Code
https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Hang%20Man
### GPIO Pins - Python/Bash LED
We added more pins to our pi and used a T-cobbler to add breadboard functionality to out pi, then we made an Led turn on 10 times using both Bash and Pythong
#### What we Learned
We learned how to import the gpio pins, how to wire up an LED to a T Cobbler which is connected to our Raspberry pi, and we finnaly pushed to git hub by ourselves.
#### Code
Bash : https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Scripts/helloled.sh 

Python : https://github.com/sliving03/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/pythonhelloled.py
### GPIO pins - SSH
We connected our PIs to the internet and were able to use them to control an LED over the web, wowie'
#### What we Learned
We learned how to access the IP adress of our pi and how to connect to out pi using the internet so we could run code remotely
### Hello Flask
We used our PIs IP adress to use it as a webserver and we were able to run code to the computer from our PI
#### What we Learned
We learned how to setup flask, hwat it can be used for, and we gained a basic understanding of our PIs connection to the interne t and how that can be used
### GPIO Pins - I2C
